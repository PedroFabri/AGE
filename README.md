ABAP Write Report Generator.

<b>THIS APP STILL IN DEVELOPMENT</b>

For now, filling the field in "example.json" and executing the "age.js" with NodeJS will generate two files:

<b>Header.txt</b> - It's the header of the write report table

<b>Line.txt</b> - It's the linde of the write report table. Put it inside a loop to generate the table.

I'll try my best to finnish this app as soon as I can.

<h3>TO DO:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Make "age.js" work without a .txt</li>
	<li>Create a RESTful structure</li>
	<li>Finish the client-side and deploy it on Heroku</li>
	<li>Allow users to use this as a RESTFul service API</li>
</ul>
